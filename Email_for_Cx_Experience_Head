# Subject: Customer Experience Feedback Analysis & Recommendations  

Hi John,  

I have completed the analysis of customer feedback, product reviews, and purchase history as requested. Below are the key findings and recommendations based on the data extracted from ShopEasy's database.  

## **Key Insights:**  

### **1. Low-Rated Products:**  
The following products have consistently low ratings and may require quality improvements:  

- **Basketball** – 2.67 Avg Rating (3 Reviews)  
- **Dumbbells** – 3.00 Avg Rating (5 Reviews)  
- **Ice Skates** – 3.00 Avg Rating (2 Reviews)  
- **Baseball Glove** – 3.40 Avg Rating (5 Reviews)  
- **Kayak** – 3.40 Avg Rating (10 Reviews)  

### **2. Negative Customer Feedback:**  
Common complaints identified in the reviews include:  

- **Product quality issues** (e.g., Dumbbells stopped working within a month).  
- **Unclear product instructions** (e.g., Basketball).  
- **Late product delivery** (e.g., Climbing Rope).  
- **Overall dissatisfaction and average experiences** (e.g., Surfboard, Kayak).  

### **3. Customer Retention Challenges:**  
- The **repeat purchase rate is low**, with only **40% of customers returning** after their first purchase.  
- **6 customers made a single purchase without returning**.  

## **Recommendations for Improvement:**  

### **1. Enhance Product Quality & Support**  
- Work with suppliers to improve the quality of low-rated products.  
- Provide clearer product instructions where necessary.  
- Address performance-related complaints through better quality control.  

### **2. Improve Customer Retention Strategies**  
- Implement **loyalty rewards** or personalized follow-ups for first-time buyers.  
- Offer discounts or targeted campaigns to encourage repeat purchases.  

### **3. Address Service Issues**  
- Ensure timely delivery to reduce complaints related to late shipments.  
- Enhance customer service responses for dissatisfaction-related queries.
